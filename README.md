This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, access the server folder and install the packages using: 

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

Done that, run the socket server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

With the socket server running, access the client folder and install the packages, using:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

After installing the packages for the client, it's time to run it, just run it in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your application will already be running!
